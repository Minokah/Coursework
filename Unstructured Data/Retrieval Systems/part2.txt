1.2. Lucene doesn't look like it uses stopwords by default right now. 'And' is returned with 8 matches even though that should be considered a common word to remove.
I also added 'the' as a possible query and it didn't remove it.

1.3. Lucene doesn't look like it uses stemming by default. I added 'their' and 'theirs' to the query and 'theirs' did not stem to 'their'. As for the
results above, I do not think it uses stemming, as none of the tokens in the search are being cut or stemmed from their original forms.

1.4. Lucene uses the BM25 metric. Aside from the documentation, looking at the results for 'love':
Searching for: love
4 total matching documents
1. documents/RJ6.txt
2. documents/RJ7.txt
3. documents/RJ1.txt
4. documents/RJ10.txt

Ignoring RJ6 and RJ7, RJ1 has it 1 time, and RJ10 has it 1 time.
If we only focus on the latter, RJ1 has 'love' above RJ10 even though they are the same.
The reason for that is because RJ1 is much shorter than RJ10, and because of BM25 it is RJ1 will be ranked higher.

2.1 Stopping
See line 107-110 in MySearchFiles.java and line 103-106 in MyIndexFiles.java.

For these results, "O" was capitalized in the stop word list, but the example of CharArraySet had case set to false by default. To make "O" work, I set the ignoreCase false to true. Below, you see that "O" is now filtered out.
We can see the words being filtered out, such as "O" in "ALAS O LOVE" is filtered out.

See line 95 in MyStandardAnalyzer.java.

Here we can see stemming, 'fiery' -> 'fieri', 'alas' -> 'ala'
