GLOVE
- More emojis show up
- Shorter results are included (compared to MiniLLM), also includes user handles (@'s)


MiniLLM
- Lots of repeats and hashtags
- Appears to be more relevant to the original query "I am looking for a job" in terms of meaning

Explanation:
My guess as to why these differences are occurring is MiniLLM is taking into account the length of the entire sentence as well as
the meaning of the query.

For example, the top result in MiniLLM: "I need a job" is very similar to the meaning of "I am looking for a job". The second result
"Does anyone know of anywhere that's hiring" is in the same vein as "I am looking for a job", ie. searching for a job to work.
Same with the third result "Can anyone recommend anyone for this #job" and an address.

To contrast with GLOVE, it is not taking in the meaning of the sentence: the first two are: "I love my job. (emojis)", and "You guys are
doing a great job." This is not relevant to the original query's meaning, "I am looking for a job". The first one is saying, the user loves their job, and the second one saying the group is performing great on their work, which isn't what the query's meaning is.

With the changes to Twitter being rebranded as X, I have to sign up for an account. Through trying the "I am looking for a job" query, I
think I can say that it does try to match what you are looking for by meaning, as I am seeing posts also mentioning that others are looking for
a job. So yes, I think Twitter/X is using a semantic search technique.
