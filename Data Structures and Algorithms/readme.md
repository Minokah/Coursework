# Data Structures and Algorithms

- **SliceMatrix**: Reads a file of Cities with positions, calculates their distances between each other, then cuts the matrix storing these distances in half.
- **Cupid**:  Labyrinth pathfinding using a stack. Cupid needs to shoot his arrows to the target on the map, but those arrows can only travel based on certain conditions. Arrows can backtrack a specified amount of times before giving up. They can also only turn based on its "inertia" value.
- **Cipher**:  Encodes and decodes a string using a shift cipher. Circular array queue.
- **ShapeTree**:  Stores various shapes with different colours into a n-ary tree.
 - **BoardGame**:  The game is played on an *n* x *n* board. The goal is to get *n* tiles vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. There however needs to be *k* empty spaces on the board. Once *k* empty spaces on the board have been reached, the player or computer can shift their tiles vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Implemented using a hash table with separate chaining
 - **Dictionary**:  Stores file names into a Binary Search Tree implementation of a dictionary which allows repeated keys. Reads a file to create the dictionary, and gives user input to access those files.
 - **Labyrinth**:  Finds a path to the exit in a labyrinth if possible using a depth first search. It will read a labyrinth file and construct the labyrinth graph. Three types of walls the way, with the user being able to input how many bombs they want to use to destroy these walls.
