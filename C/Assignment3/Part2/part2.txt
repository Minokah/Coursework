Files

1. echo * can list all the files in the current directory. echo prints to the terminal, while * is a selector for everything in the current directory.

2. The -i option will prompt the user before deleting a file/folder. The -f option will never prompt the user and ignores all other arguments (so force will have precedence).

3. mv allows you to move files to different directories AND rename them at the same time, if one wishes. rename does not have that option, but it allows a user to easily bulk rename files within a folder using regular expression when compared to doing it using mv and a bash script.

4. ELF means Executable and Linkable Format

5. ls lists the actual size of the content (ie. the text within the actual file), which du shows how much space the file is taking up in general/on the disk (ie. it's existence in the system will take up some form of space)

Directories

1. mkdir -p grandparent/parent/child

2. mkdir "Folder With Space", rmdir "Folder With Space"

3. mkdir folderName -m a=,u=rx

4. cd - or use pushd and popd

5. To view the list of traversed folders, use dirs -v. Then, to traverse back to a folder within that list, do cd ~# where # is the folder number you want to go to. To visit the 6th folder after you've added 10 folders to the stack, you would do cd ~4, as the latest folder is 0 and the very first folder is n-1.

Permissions

1. chmod -c ...

2. chown --reference=file1 file2

3. stat -c=%A,%G,%g .

4. Put the file inside a folder and mark the folder's permissions as only read and execute. Make sure the file inside has the write permission.

5. It will add the execute permission to all groups (user, group, other).
