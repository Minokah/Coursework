  - Hey! I'm Kyle. Nice to meet you!
  - To start, let me ask you a question.
  - Do you like Unity?
  - Yes
  - No
  - That's good to hear! I'm so glad you enjoy it.
  - Happy Kyle
  - What!? You don't like Unity? That's a shame... anyways.
  - Sad Kyle
  - Next question... What is your favourite flavour of ice cream?
  - Chocolate
  - Vanilla
  - Strawberry
  - I don't actually like ice cream
  - Chocolate, brown and sweet! A very popular choice.
  - Vanilla, white as snow... almost. Good pick!
  - You also like strawberry! It's my favourite flavour!
  - WHAT!? Who doesn't like ice cream? Preposterous! Absurd! Inconceivable!
  - ... sorry for the outburst. I don't think I can look at you the same way anymore...
    let's just move on.
  - Hmm. Looks like I've run out of questions. We'll have to cut it short here.
  - It was really nice speaking with you! I hope we can speak again sometime.
  - Until then... have a nice day!
