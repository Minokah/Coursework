# Databases
For both of these assignments, we had to use a database which included hospital, doctor, and patient information. Use createdatabase.sql to generate the data used.
- **Assignment 2** - Write a bunch of SQL prompts to do some stuff like query, insert, delete, etc.
- **Assignment 3** - In the listed assignment, we had to create a website using HTML, PHP, and optionally CSS or JavaScript for a hospital database. I decided to use Bootstrap in my website to make it look nicer.
